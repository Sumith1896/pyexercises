#NSS Project

###Topic
Survey about newspaper disposal in hostels and plan a small model for disposal of the same.

###Approach
Each hostel council was approached and a questionnaire was put forward
1. What is the number of newspapers that you get everyday?
2. How is it disposed at the end of the day?
3. Is somebody from the council responsible for looking after this system?
4. Their views about disposal scheme applied in other hostels.
5. Are you willing to adopt a new model, if NSS comes up with one?

###Survey result
Answer to question 3 and 5 were same(within limits) by all hostels.<br/>
Answer to question 3 being that this cycle was self-sustained and didn't require any special attention from the hostel council. Though, in some hostels if problems arose, the library secy or the lit secy were responsible to sort it out.<br/>
Answer to question 5 being that if the model is good and if pitched convincingly, the council will be more than willing to adopt them.

###H15
**Information Source**: Prasanna Tare(Warden Nominee)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 15<br/>
**Scene**: PHO workers take it who later sell but in a very irregular basis, else the newspapers are thrown in waste. The irregularity is because PHO workers have not been officially told to do this. Before it used to happen that they were sold by the hostel council and the money was added to hostel amenities fund but then it was stopped because
1. There was nobody to follow up.
2. The money got hardly made a difference to funds.

###H1
**Information Source**: Jambeswa(Lib. and Lit Secy)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 17<br/>
**Scene**: Stored in a cupboard and sold at the end of month. Money added to hostel funds. He feels this is the right thing to do and the money should go to the hostel council.

###H5
**Information Source**: Shashank Patidar(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 30<br/>
**Scene**: PHO workers collect for common room and some rooms as well and sell it. This happens only in first semester. In the second semester, they are collected and used for PAF.

###H7
**Information Source**: Archit Laddha(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 15<br/>
**Scene**: PHO workers collect it. Why? PHO workers get an incentive to put them in place and keep the common room clean.

###H8
**Information Source**: Bhavik Jain(Warden Nominee)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 5-6<br/>
**Scene**: PHO workers take it and sell it, on a irregular basis. 

###H10
**Information Source**: Madhu Lekha(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 4<br/>
**Scene**: Hostel collects, sells and adds it to the hostel funds. No problems faced with this system upto now.

###H10A
**Information Source**: Garima(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 6-7<br/>
**Scene**: Newspaper are collected and sold at the end of the month by office staff. In the second semester, the newspapers collected are used in PAF.

###H11
**Information Source**: Neha Bhargava(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 4-5<br/>
**Scene**: Most of newspapers are lost or people take it with them. Whatever minimal is remaining is collected and sold by the hostel.

###H12
**Information Source**: Ashutosh(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 20-22<br/>
**Scene**: Unsure about what actually happens. But feels that PHO are keeping the newspapers in a irregular basis.

###H13
**Information Source**: Raj Kumar Yadav(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 20<br/>
**Scene**: The newspapers collected are sold at the end of the month and the money is added to the hostel funds. Doesn't actually feels the need to change the mechanisms and shift to PHO because PHO workers are anyway given bonus by hostel on occasions like Diwali and other festivals.

###H14
**Information Source**: Mayuresh Pant(General Secretary)<br/>
**No. of newspapers**: 15-18<br/>
**Scene**: Box to collect newspapers kept in common and TV room. PHO workers are allowed to sell this.

###Money got by selling newspapers
On an average, papers for 1 month weigh 25 - 30 kg. Most raddhiwallas (scrap dealers) will pay Rs 5.5 - Rs 5.75 per kilogram for English newspapers. By bargaining you can get a better price. On an average you can easily earn Rs 100-Rs 120 a month per newspaper.

**Note**: Information from all hostels could not be collected but trend is clear, one half adopts the PHO method and other half sell it and add to the hostel funds. Some hostel council/G.Secys reasoned that they were busy due to valfis happening and hence information could not be obtained.

###Results
Overall we see that two methods are followed largely, both have pros and cons
####Method 1 : PHO
PHO are given liberty to collect it, sell it and keep the money.
#####Pros
1. PHO workers get an incentive to keep all the newspapers collected and clean.
2. The money obtained hardly affects the hostel funds but will be of value to some poor PHO workers.
#####Cons
1. Make sure that the distribution equally among PHO workers
####Method 2 : Hostel 
Hostel keeps it, sells it at the end of month, money goes to hostel amenities fund else the newspaper is used for other purposes.
#####Pros
1. Hostel pays for newspapers, hence gets back considerable amount back by selling.
2. Newspapers are used a lot in PAF.
3. PHO workers are given bonus from hostel funds anyways, hence forming a loop.
#####Cons
1. Somebody should follow up on whether the newspaper is collected or not.
2. Hard to make sure the money actually goes to the fund or elsewhere.

There is no clear cut winner but in my personal say PHO workers is a better method and in my hostel I encourage this atleast. 

###What could be done?
This project can be extended and hence can near to completion in the following ways
1. Collect information from more hostels.
2. Present this in front of concerned authorities and student heads and have a open debate with these people together where some conclusion can be reached.
3. Then, all the hostel council should be encouraged to adopt this model.

###Acknowledgements
I thank all the council members for taking time from their very busy schedule for this survey. I also thank my department heads,Swaroop and Harsh, for giving me an oppurtunity to do the survey under the NSS name. Under personal name, this info would have been hard to obtain. This had been a great experience interacting with everyone, I enjoyed it.
